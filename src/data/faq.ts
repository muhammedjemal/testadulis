    question: `What's the difference between a master artwork and a print?`,
    answer:
      "Our master artworks are original pieces, carefully selected for their unique quality and artistic significance. They are the original works by our featured artists. Prints, on the other hand, are high-quality, signed reproductions of these master artworks, offered in limited editions. This allows more people to own a piece of Ethiopian heritage at a more accessible price point while still supporting our artists",
